# AdvancementMerger
This is a simple python script for merging two advancement files into one json file for PaperMC Server (same user, different UUID because server went from offline/crack mode to online mode).

Just put two json files in the same folder as `merge.py` and run the script. This will output a file named `UUIDHERE.json` and replace `UUIDHERE` with the target UUID.

> [!NOTE]
> This is tested on VERSION 1.21.11 and json Data Version 4671 and haven't tested other versions. Any problems using this script I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE AS THIS TOOL IS PROVIDED AS IS. ANY LOSS OF ADVANCEMENT JSON FILES IS UP TO THE USER AND THE AUTHOR WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE.
